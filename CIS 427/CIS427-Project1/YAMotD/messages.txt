Early to bed, early to rise, makes one healthy, wealthy, and wise.
One can never be too rich, too thin, or have too much bandwidth.
Excuses are tools of incompetence, they build monuments of nothingness, and those who specialize in them seldom accomplish anything.
Silently hear everyone. Accept what is good. Reject and forget what is not. This is intelligent living.
A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks that others throw at him.
